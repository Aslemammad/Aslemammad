## Projects | <i>Products</i>

Projects that I worked on.

### <a href='https://front.seritaa.com'>Seritaa</a> <i>Front-end</i>

- A web app for taking plans, consultations and... from doctors.

I learned about new libraries like MobX and MobX-State-tree, and technologies like CSS-modules. We went through the URL queries problems, faced them, and we solved them with some advice from KentcDodds about URL queries and how to watch them. We struggled through the directories structures, there were problems, but we learned things about better structures. I helped move the project from `getInitialProps` to `getServerSideProps`, so we reached better security, better performance, and better DX (developer-expreience). Here, I realized that we have to work with a team, everything gets better, more productive, great result and we'll get more friends. 

### <a href='/'>Fiction</a> <i>Back-end</i> <i>coming soon</i>

- Share your products, see products, buy and download them.

I got familiar with unique patterns like controllers and services in nodejs, they had some trade-offs in DX, because I had to move things sometimes, but they were great and structural. The most amazing thing I was so excited for, at the time, it was typescript, I wrote the whole project with typescript, so I knew what I was doing and what I want. I was lucky for this too, because I had great Front-end team for the project.

## Projects | <i>Open-source</i>

Open source Projects that I wrote or contributed to:

### <a href='https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai'>Jotai</a>

- Ghost Primitive, flexible state management for React
- Passed 40000/Week downloads

That's why I keep telling people they should care about contributing; I even made a post about that in my blog. With contributing to jotai, I learned about micro-tasks, promise underhood, better bundling, react-query and even a little bit about immerjs. Contributing to such a project made me into [Poimandres](https://github.com/pmndrs), A lovely group of enthusiasts and talented people.

### <a href='https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio'>Valtio</a>

- Valtio makes proxy-state simple for React and Vanilla
- Fast & easy

When it comes to proxies, everything changes, such a beautiful concept in javascript, we created a small library that allows you to count on mutating instead of setState lines. I explored Reflect global object, proxies and promise batching. I even made an eslint plugin for this library, and it took me into the eslint plugins world.

### <a href='https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector'>Use-context-selector</a>

- React useContextSelector hook in userland
- A faster React context

I learned where to use useMemo, and other React memoization utils, they are great utils but dangerous sometimes.  

### <a href='https://github.com/Aslemammad/contextism'>Contextism</a>

- React package to Improve your hooks and React context, So have bettter state management
- Passed 1000/Week downloads
- Type strict

In my first ever library, I was inspired by one of Kent's articles and made it. You'll achieve better performance with contextism. I learned Rollup and more about React in this little library; it was one of the most incredible journeys.

### <a href='https://github.com/Aslemammad/Xmoji'>Xmoji</a>

- We don't have strong emoji picker for our OS, So I built Xmoji for Win/linux with React/Electron
- Strong, Fast, Customizable

Made my typescript stronger, solved many needs and learned how to create good electron apps.

### <a href='https://github.com/Aslemammad/Bugged.dev'>Bugged.dev</a>

- My own SSG Blog for sharing knowledge.

With blogs like this, I found out how amazing next can be. I learned more about Tailwind in this project and even made my light-house and SEO knowledge stronger.
